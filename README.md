Open-Source 3D Internet Metaverse - 3D CMS (Content Management System) to Build Games and 3D Shopping Websites
Invented and created by Aaron Dishno Ed.D. CIO and Founder of HTTP3D Inc. - WalkTheWeb

I believe the Internet should always be Free and Available to all. Do you really want the big gaming companies to own the Metaverse and kill the full potential with censorship and advertising? Help me build a Free 3D Internet Metaverse by using and supporting Open-Source WalkTheWeb. I am calling for PROGRAMMERS, DESIGNERS, and ARTISTS to unite! So that Everyone owns the Metaverse.

To start, create your own Metaverse with our easy to use WalkTheWeb 3D Internet Hosting software. While you do not have to be a programmer to use it, programmers can easily take advantage of the Babylonjs.com Game Engine and build 3D Games and 3D Content using our 3D CMS software and your own code together. 3D Artists (3D Model Designers) can show off their work quickly in a working environment with Avatars and 3D Scenes.  Multiplayer functionality and services are readily available from WalkTheWeb (keeps the work load off your server). Babylonjs.com supports browser based devices that can use WebGL and 3D Scenes can be viewed by numerous camera views for Computers, Cell Phones, Tablets, and Virtual Reality equipment (VR). WalkTheWeb uses PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL it can be hosted on any server capable of running WordPress.

3D CMS is a 3D Content Management System for easily creating and hosting your own 3D Games, 3D Shopping Stores, 3D Metaverse, and 3D Multiverse Scenes. Using the Babylonjs.com game engine WalkTheWeb works completely in the browser (does not download an app). You can put each of your 3D Buildings or 3D Games into many 3D Community Scenes. Makes it easy to update your 3D Game or 3D Shopping Store in one place, yet provides a powerful new way to distribute your creations by allowing your 3D Building (or 3D Game) to be visited in many 3D Scenes! Think of it as combining the concept of WordPress with a 3D Game Engine at an exponential level!

Optional enhancement: Connect your 3D Store (WordPress and WooCommerce) using the WalkTheWeb WordPress Plugin: https://wordpress.org/plugins/walktheweb/

INSTALLATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  To Install, copy the files into the root of a website.
2.  It is highly recommended to start your URL with http://3d.  or   https://3d. to 
    signify it is a WalkTheWeb 3D Website and help others find your Metaverse!
3.  The browser user (inetuser) will need write access in the entire folder for updates.
4.  Optional: you can manually download updates and overwrite the program files, 
    but the /content folder must have write permissions for Admin user uploads.
5.  Set up your database and database user in MySQL or MariaDB.
6.  Open the website to configure and launch.
7.  Optional: You can manually configure the settings as /config/wtw_config.php
    (sample config file is provided in the /config folder)
    Open the website to complete the installation.
8.  After installation completes, feel free to checkout the additional WalkTheWeb downloads in the Admin Menu - Media Library.

That is it!

UPDATING WALKTHEWEB
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Backup your website files and database.
2.  Log into your website and open Admin Home (tool icon in the menu).
3.  For automated update - Requires the 3D Internet Plugin to be enabled. Go to Dashboard - Updates - click the update button if it appears.
4.  For manual updates - Does not require the 3D Internet Plugin enabled. Download the code and unzip it to the root of the website. It will overwrite the necessary files in connect, core, content/system, and content/plugins (only on the bundled plugins).
5.  Most Important: Refresh your website in the browser in Admin Mode. This will perform any needed database table updates and load the newly updated code.
